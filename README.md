# RetroDECK on your device!

**RetroDECK** in application that brings a sandbox environment to catalog and play your retro games directly on your:
<br/><br/>
**Steam Deck**
<br/>
**Linux Desktop** (after the BETA period)
<br/>
**SteamOS Device** (after the BETA period)

It's inspired by embedded emulation systems like AmberELEC, EmuELEC, CoreELEC, Lakka, and Batocera.

Powered by [EmulationStation Desktop Edition](https://es-de.org), which uses RetroArch and other standalone emulators to allow you to import and play your favorite retro (and even not-so-retro) games in a tidy contained environment.

### RetroDECK is tailored to the Steam Deck during the BETA period.
The goal is that all the configurations are ready to go and tweaked to get the best graphics and performance on the Deck without having the hassle of choosing, installing and configuring tons of emulators: just put your ROMS & BIOSes in the corresponding folders and start your games.

# Short FAQ

Please read the [Wiki](https://github.com/XargonWan/RetroDECK/wiki) for even more information.

## Do I have to partition or format my disk/sdcard to install it?
No, partitioning or formatting is note needed at all. RetroDECK (differently from AmberELEC, Batocera and others) comes as a flatpak: just install it as any other application and launch it from your desktop or Steam library. 

## Is it available on Windows?
No, RetroDECK doesn't support Windows, but the project is fully open source so you can port it if you wish. As an alternative, [Retrobat](http://www.retrobat.ovh/) offers similar functionality (but may not be compatible with RetroDECK's rom paths).

## Do you support the Linux Desktop?
RetroDECK does work if you do some input changes on the Linux Desktop but is not officially supported during the BETA period and there could be other issues. But we do plan to support it in the future.

## Do you support other SteamOS based devices?
We do plan to support other SteamOS devices in the future.

## How can I install it?
Just install it from Discover store on the Steam Decks desktop mode or for the the Linux desktop download it from your normal software channel.
<br/>
However if you want to test the cooker version you can follow the [Installation instructions](https://github.com/XargonWan/RetroDECK/wiki/How-to:-Getting-started) on the Wiki
